NLP
-----
OLD algorithm is similarity based classification, 
Today's algorithm based on contextual basis e.g bird algorithm is best
Voice to text, text to voice, NLP best example is Chat GPT 4
PROMPT ENGINEER, FINE TUNE COURSE ARE MUST FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI

Active learning: After model pridiction data, human validate prediction mark true/false is call Active learning. Active learning pipeline should be well versed by us

Various Techniques to useConvert text to number:
1. vectorisation

Sentiment Analsyis on Kaggle dataset

spacy, nltk are nlp packages most widely used packages

NER (Name, entity, recongnition)

Tehcniques:
unidecode
nltk
nltk.corpus (All vocablaries for data you are using)
stopwords (purpose not relates to context) e.g, is, am, are, the //remove these words. Stopwords are different according to the languarage
Tokenize (assign no. to each word) means word boundary for e.g breast cancer three words combine together to give same meaning. Domain expert can build tokenizer
Lemmatizer: convert any word into its root word e.g cats root word is cat, verb 1st,2nd or third form action is same etc. Stemming is same
Speller: auto correct word

Run in colab
first we need to analyse data, read atlease 1000 triles

Lemmatization
import nltk
wordnet is corpus/dataset for general purpose

Create Virtual environmnet
-------------------
python -m venv abc

pip freez > requirement.txt (get all installed packages name in requirement.txt 

Vectorisation techniques:
--------------------------
1. Word Embedding (word clustering): for e.g gender specific word like man, male, king, 
   best technique

 2. tf-idf (explore by ourself)

 3. N-Gram technique 
 4. 
	
Chat gpt (generative pretrain transform)

Assignment:
-----------
after converting data into tensor then pass on to classifier for eg. svm, decsion tree etc

Preprocessing is our responsibility
Recurrent Neural network(RNN) use for sequential data (sequence of words, text)
Conv2D use for Computer vission
Con1D algorithm use to train textual data

Textual data processing techniques:
-----------------------------------
RNN is initial
LSTM
GRU
Transformer 
bird transformer


Sentiment analysis means negative or positive reviews (binary classification)
