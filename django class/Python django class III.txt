What is App:
------------
django provide scenario through which we can create App

- Scalability
- We can create multiple application in single project. 
  We can change any application without impacting other 
  application in a single project

In this class, we can create multiple applications alongwith their URLs
Its upto user to create single template folder for multiple application or
single template for single application

Project URLs and Application URLs
browser URLs goes to project URLs and redirect to particular application URL

To create a project, following command:
--------------------
django -admin startproject institute
cd .\institute\  ---to load a project
django -admin startapp students ---creating an app name student
django -admin startapp teachers ---creating an app name teachers
python manage.py startapp staff
--- now three applications have been created so far

For the time being delete two apps and keep only 1 app for understanding

Go to urls.py file and go 
urlpatterns = [
	path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
	path('',views.i_home, name='i_home')

]
create view file as views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from jango.urls import path,include
from .imports views

def i_home(request):
	return render(request, 'home.html')
]
--create templates folder
home.html

<body>
  <h1>	Welcome to my institute home page </h1>
....

templates folder must be created on manage.py location
In sub applications, views.py file by default available and we need to create urls.py file as below
We need to copy urls.py file and create file urls.py in student application
paste project urls data in urls.py in student

---Now go to institute project and add following path in urlpatters
path ('students', include('students.urls')),

--Now when main project receives url request from browser then it redirect url in student application

In student application, add url pattern path as:
urlpatters = [
	path('',views.home, name='home')
---Now we need to code in views.py in student application 
def home(request):
	return render(request,"students/home.html")

Project ki setting me ja kar jitney bhi apps hum banatey hen wo add karani parti hen
INSTALLED_APPS = [....
	'students',

]

if we want to add more pages in student app then make html file in templete/student folder and add this page in views.py in institute (main app) as

urlpatterns=[
... path('students/', include('students.urls'))

Go to Students application urls.py and add following:
urlpatterns = [
	path('/about', views.about,name='about')


Start New Application:
-------------------------
djangoEnv) ..> python manage.py startapp teachers
djangoEnv) ..> python manage.py runserver
view already present
url file to be created. Copy url file from student and paste on teachers folder
set url in project file as well as in teacher file
Project file:   ->> Add url pattern as
	urlpattern = [
			.
			.
		path('teachers', include('teachers.urls')),
	,]

Teacher file:  ->> Add url pattern as	
	urlpattern = [
		path('',views,home,name='home')

Go to view of Teachers file and define function in views
	from django.shortcuts improt render
	def home(request)
		return render(request,'teachers/home.html')
Create teachers folder in template folder on main project file:
In teacher folder create file name home.html and add some text in html
<body> 
	<h1> Thi si steachers home page </h1>


Copy student about.html and paste this file in teachers template folder
Add view of about in teachers folder
	def about(request)
		return render(request,'teachers/about.html')
Add url of abount in teachers folder in url.py
	urlpattern = ....path('/about',views.about,name='about')
